# Statutes of the SPIU Cooperative

with registered office in Köniz near Bern

## I. Foundation
### Art. 1 – Legal Form and Registered Office
The **Swiss Public Inference Utility Cooperative** (SPIU Cooperative, or simply SPIU) is a cooperative pursuant to 
these statutes and the provisions of Articles 828 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations, with its registered office at Könizstrasse 298, 3098 Köniz.

### Art. 2 – Purpose

To build a platform for personal performance data and thereby
- protect
- defend (their rights against all third parties)
- financially involve the cooperative members.

tl;dr

1. The cooperative aims, in a non-profit manner,

<ol type="a" start="a"> 

<li>to operate a secure collaboration platform (hereinafter "SPIU Platform") for initiating, managing, and sharing interactions with public agents based on LLM technology, and to make it available to external service providers;</li>

<li>to make the SPIU Platform available to natural persons (members and third parties) who participate in the platform as "users";</li> 

<li>to promote broad cooperative membership among users and to enable them, as cooperative members, to pursue their common interests;</li> 

<li>to safeguard the collective interests of the users by using their personal data, with their consent, as a shared resource. This is done by building an IT infrastructure that enables users to accept third-party requests for analysis of their personal data and to give explicit and informed consent to the secondary use of their personal data by third parties, resulting in financial compensation for the cooperative;</li> 

<li>to promote, through the SPIU Platform, the development of an innovative ecosystem in which third parties can offer services based on the data hosted on the platform;</li> 

<li>to support research projects and other initiatives aimed at creating a fair digital society and promoting digital self-determination of the population;</li> 

<li>to use the scientific results gained from the secondary use of personal data and the income resulting from such secondary use within the scope of the purposes mentioned above;</li> 

<li>to serve as a data refuge in emergencies when other members or users are attacked or compromised.</li> 
</ol>

3. It defends the data rights of its members against third parties and grants access to data only in anonymized form so that the rights, security, and privacy of the members are preserved.

4. The cooperative aims to achieve a positive impact on society and the environment in its operational and commercial activities.

5. The cooperative may carry out all activities directly or indirectly related to its purpose.

6. The cooperative may support the founding of cooperatives with the same purpose in Switzerland and abroad and may join with them to form an alliance of cooperatives.

7. The cooperative may establish subsidiaries in Switzerland and abroad, participate in other companies in Switzerland and abroad, and acquire, hold, and sell real estate.

### Art. 3 – Platform Access and Services

Cooperative members and non-members may participate as users on the SPIU Platform and use the associated services.

Use of the SPIU Platform and its associated services may be subject to fees.

### Art. 4 – Users’ Authority Over Their Personal Data

Each user individually controls their personal data stored on the SPIU Platform with respect to the cooperative.

Users collectively control the sharing of their personal data (or specific subsets thereof) via the SPIU Platform with third parties. The right to abstain from participating in projects with third parties is preserved.

Users have the right to export their personal data from the SPIU Platform in a documented data format.

Users have the right to delete their personal data from the platform.

Users have the right to close their account.

For exceptional situations (hacking attacks, liquidation, sale), specific data guidelines will be developed and enacted.

### Art. 5 – Nature of Data Exchange

Third-party access to a user’s personal data (or specific subsets thereof) requires their explicit and informed consent.

This applies to access in original, encrypted (linked to a specific person through a key), and anonymized (traceable to a specific person only with disproportionate effort) form.
Use of the data by third parties is reviewed by the cooperative’s Ethics Council.

The cooperative strives to ensure that user data does not leave the SPIU Platform, or that data is not duplicated by third parties in a way that prevents the cooperative from protecting it.

The cooperative does not provide services that would allow users to sell access to their personal data for individual compensation. Users and members have no right to misuse the SPIU Platform in this regard.
This avoids ethically problematic individual financial incentives.

### Art. 6 – Use of Net Profit

Net profit shall primarily be used to improve the quality and quantity of services offered with and through the SPIU Platform, to ensure financial sustainability, and to pursue the cooperative’s non-profit purposes pursuant to Art. 2.

The cooperative may distribute dividends. For this purpose, a reserve fund of a maximum of 10% per year is created. It must amount to at least 50% of the cooperative capital before the first dividend distribution takes place.

### Art. 7 – Cooperative Shares

2. Each member must subscribe to 2 shares in the first year and one additional share in each following year.
A member may acquire a maximum of 5 shares per year.
The shares are non-interest-bearing.

### Art. 8 – Premiums

We are currently examining possible reward mechanisms for participation in the data cooperative. Once the members and the board agree on a token that can be used to assess contributions and other forms of participation, this system will be codified here.

### Art. 9 – Liability
