            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Developing large language technologies as a public service tool can revolutionize the way individuals interact with information, improving access to knowledge and resources. <strong>Public AI</strong> is a movement and vision for open-source AI that emphasizes sustainability, optimizes for social impact and reduces reliance on monopolistic and proprietary models.</p>

            <p>By prioritizing sovereignty and neutrality, we can try to ensure the service remains unbiased, let users understand transparently how their data is handled, how governance decisions are made. Ultimately, this gives individuals more agency over how they use and build on AI. To tackle this complex challenge, research and development can begin with a variety of datasets and resources. For instance, using large, publicly available datasets like <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/" target="_blank">Common Crawl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/fineweb-2" target="_blank">FineWeb 2</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikimedia/wikipedia" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, news archives or legal texts, to provide a comprehensive foundation. Additionally, there are APIs like <a href="https://openrouter.ai/" target="_blank">OpenRouter</a> or <a href="https://endpoints.huggingface.co/" target="_blank">Hugging Face</a> that offer pre-trained models under permissive licenses—these can be used in conjunction with a pooled community effort to tune and customize a model. It's also essential to incorporate multilingual data to reflect global accessibility and inclusivity, leveraging resources from platforms like <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Helsinki-NLP/open_subtitles" target="_blank">OpenSubtitles</a> for translation and various global news services for content variety.</p>

            <p><strong>Implementing a large language model as a public service tool could be transformative, impacting society in several areas.</strong> By focusing on sustainability and transparency to minimize environmental and political biases, the tool can become a trusted source of information. It could democratize access to knowledge, bridging gaps for individuals in underserved areas or with lesser economic resources, offering clear explanations or translations at a personal level. Moreover, ensuring user agency means that individuals can interact with the AI in a safe, informed manner—understanding the potential risks of AI while benefiting from its capabilities. This approach could shift the landscape for how AI is developed, used, and governed in the public sphere, leading to more inclusive, responsible, and community-driven technological advancements.</p>
